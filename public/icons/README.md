# Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files:

- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

You can create these icons using any image editing tool. For a simple MVP, you can use online tools like:
- https://www.favicon-generator.org/
- https://www.canva.com/

Or create them programmatically using tools like ImageMagick or generate SVG icons and convert them to PNG.

For now, you'll need to add these manually before loading the extension into Chrome.
